# Array_special_product:

Implement a function which, given an array of integers, returns a new array for which
every index carries the value of the product of the remaining elements. 

Example:

Given array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] it would return [120, 40, 60, 30, 24]
Given array [4, 10, 3] itwould return [30, 12, 40]
